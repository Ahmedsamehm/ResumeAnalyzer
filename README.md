## 🧪 Why This Project?

I wanted to build a tool that makes resume evaluation smarter and more accessible:

- Upload and **store resumes** securely in the cloud
- Match resumes to **job listings** using AI evaluations
- Deliver **ATS scores** and personalized feedback
- Keep the UI **clean, reusable, and responsive**

The goal was to combine **React Router v7**, **Puter.js**, and **Zustand** to create a modular, scalable application.
